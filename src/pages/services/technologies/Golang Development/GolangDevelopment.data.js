    "Golang, was specifically designed to build simple, efficient, and reliable software. The intention was to get the perfect balance between performance and control, combined with the experience of the developer. Most software development solutions were struggling with clumsiness and slow speed. Golang was a perfect way out of these issues as it makes the process more productive and scalable. The minds behind this programming language are the ones who were tired of cluttered languages with unnecessary elements. These experts were involved in writing, reading, and debugging software systems. Whether you are a multinational company or a startup, the Golang development service will take care of cloud services, IoT, distributed networks, and other backend technologies."
