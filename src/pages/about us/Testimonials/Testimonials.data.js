We have worked with Istellar for almost a year. Their team of talented developers helped us to build a bilingual (Arabic and English) websites & applications. Our previous IT provider architecture the bilingual application with 2 different CFM files for each language with partial RTL support. But Istellar have accomplished this with single code file with full RTL support. Because of this, our project delivery time, development cost and maintenance cost reduced almost 40 percentage. They developed modules to integrate our application with Bar code, QR code scanner and printer. We did RFID read write modules integration as well with the help of Istellar team. They are smart working developing company in ColdFusion arena. I would recommend them to anyone for web development work. Hope I wish to do some more projects with the team in future.  ",
